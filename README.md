# strawfordthomas.github.io

A simple portfolio website based on the [minimal](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/) theme. The LHS panel is used as a menu to navigate between separate scrolling pages.

## Editing pages

There are separate markdown(.md) files for each page of the website (that is, the separate pieces of content that appear on the right hand side section of the website). Markdown is a very simple scripting langauge that allows you to format writing for the web. For the main part it just looks like writing. 

The kinds of formatting you can add to documents can be seen [here](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/). You can put an asterix (\*) on each side of a word to make it *italicised*, or you can use two (\*\*) to make it **bold.**

The hash sign (\#) is used at the start of a line in order to change that text into a heading. One hash gives you the biggest size of heading and six gives you the smallest.

#### Size four heading

##### Size five heading

###### Size six heading

You can also use markdown to format bullet points and lists, but maybe you don't need those here.

Adding links to your text is a matter of putting the word or phrase you want to be the link in \[square brackets]\ and the link itself straight afterwards in brackets, like \[google](http://www.google.com).
